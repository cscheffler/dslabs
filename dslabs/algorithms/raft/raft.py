"""Guidance and scaffolding for implementing the Raft consensus algorithm.

This module mirrors the structure described in *Raft: In Search of an
Understandable Consensus Algorithm* (Ongaro & Ousterhout, 2014). The goal is to
provide you with explicit hooks, rich documentation, and light-weight
scaffolding so that the implementation can focus on the algorithmic ideas:
leader election, log replication, safety, and the interaction with application
state machines.

You should:

* Read the Raft paper and map each major concept to the methods declared here.
* Rely on `dslabs.protocols.Transport` for network I/O and `dslabs.protocols.Scheduler`
  for timers; the unit tests in tests/test_raft_algorithm.py inject fake
  implementations of these protocols to keep the logic deterministic.
* Follow the provided docstrings and inline comments as a step-by-step outline
  when filling in each method. The comments are not exhaustive, but they call
  out important conditions, state transitions, and message flows that must be handled.

Until the algorithm is implemented, the stubs intentionally raise `NotImplementedError`
so that the unit tests fail, reminding you to finish the implementation.

class RaftState(str, Enum):
    """
    High-level role assumed by a Raft node.

    Raft rotates between three roles:

    ``FOLLOWER``
        Passive role, responds to requests from leaders or candidates and resets
        its election timeout when heartbeats arrive.

    ``CANDIDATE``
        Initiated after an election timeout; the node increments its term,
        votes for itself, and requests votes from peers in pursuit of
        leadership.

    ``LEADER``
        The node responsible for log replication and serving client requests.
        Leaders send periodic AppendEntries heartbeats to maintain authority.

@dataclass
class LogEntry:
    """
    Single entry stored within the replicated log.

    Parameters
    ----------
    term:
        Election term under which the entry was created by the leader. Raft
        relies on term comparisons to uphold the *log matching* property.
    command:
        Opaque client command that should be applied to the state machine once
        committed. The implementation decides the structure (dict, tuple, etc.).
    """

    term: int
    command: Any


@dataclass
class Raft:
    """
    Skeleton of the Raft state machine.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    node_id:
        Identifier for this node. Raft messages carry string identifiers and
        the tests use human-readable values ("n1", "n2", etc.).
    peers:
        List of node identifiers participating in the cluster. The local node
        may or may not appear in this list, depending on how the runner builds
        membership; the implementation should be robust to either choice.
    transport:
        Implementation of `dslabs.protocols.Transport` used to send Raft
        protocol messages. You must call `transport.send` with JSON-like
        dictionaries describing RequestVote and AppendEntries interactions.
    scheduler:
        Implementation of `dslabs.protocols.Scheduler` that provides election
        timeouts and heartbeat intervals. Timers are critical to Raftâ€™s
        liveness guarantees.
    apply:
        Callback invoked with ``(command, index)`` whenever an entry becomes
        committed and should be applied to the replicated state machine. The
        tests assert on this hook to check that commits are signalled correctly.

    Attributes
    ----------
    state:
        Current `RaftState`. Start as follower, transition per the paper.
    current_term / voted_for:
        Persistent election metadata. `current_term` increments on new elections;
        `voted_for` tracks which candidate received our vote in the current term
        (or `None` if no vote was cast yet).
    log:
        In-memory log containing `LogEntry` entries. Index 0 corresponds to the
        first command appended by any leader.
    commit_index / last_applied:
        Match the definitions from the paper. `commit_index` tracks the highest
        log index known to be committed; `last_applied` is the highest index
        already delivered to `apply`.
    next_index / match_index:
        Leader-only replication metadata. `next_index` is the next log index
        that should be sent to each follower; `match_index` stores the highest
        index known to be replicated on each follower.
    leader_id:
        Convenience field to remember the current leader (useful for followers
        redirecting client requests).
    _election_timer / _heartbeat_timer:
        Handles returned by `scheduler.call_later` so timers can be cancelled
        or reset. Private because the tests do not rely on their exact type.

           inbound RPCs are delivered to this instance.
        #. Reset state as necessary (e.g., ensure leader-specific maps are
           cleared when starting as a follower).
        #. Schedule a randomized election timeout via `_reset_election_timer`
           so the node eventually transitions to a candidate if no leader is

        Raft exchanges two primary message types:

        `request_vote` / `request_vote_response`
            Used during elections. Followers decide whether to grant votes; the
            candidate tallies responses to determine leadership.

        Implementation outline:

        #. Inspect `msg["type"]` and branch accordingly.
        #. Handle term comparisons first: if the incoming `term` is greater
           than `current_term` the node must step down to follower and update
           `current_term` (Raft guarantees are rooted in monotonic term
           numbers).
        #. Delegate to helper methods such as `_handle_request_vote` or
           `_handle_append_entries` that you should implement.

           responses get sent using `transport.send`.
